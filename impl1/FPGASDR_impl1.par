Pin Constraint Summary:
   16 out of 34 pins locked (47% locked).

WARNING - par: RPLL must be put in reset state during background Flash programming. System design must take this into consideration when PLL is used during background Flash programming. Please see TN1204 MachXO2 Programming and Configuration Usage Guide for detailed information.
WARNING - par: PIO driver comp "XIn" of PLL "PLL1/PLLInst_0" CLKI input will be placed on a non-dedicated PIO site "57/PB26A"; therefore, general routing has to be used.
The following 1 signal is selected to use the primary clock routing resources:
    osc_clk (driver: PLL1/PLLInst_0, clk load #: 591)


The following 8 signals are selected to use the secondary clock routing resources:

*****************************************************************
Info: NBR allows conflicts(one node used by more than one signal)
      in the earlier iterations. In each iteration, it tries to  
      solve the conflicts while keeping the critical connections 
      routed as short as possible. The routing process is said to
      be completed when no conflicts exist and all connections   
      are routed.                                                
Note: NBR uses a different method to calculate timing slacks. The
      worst slack and total negative slack may not be the same as
      that in TRCE report. You should always run TRCE to verify  
      your design.
